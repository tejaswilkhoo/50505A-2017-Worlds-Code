2018 was the Vex In the Zone season, filled with cones and building really big robots trying to stack cones. 
This year was my first year in VRC and was coincidentally the last year that teams got to use Vex Cortex, next year they switched to their new system of Vex V5.
Even their programming software was old, called RobotC. 
Honestly I've been using RobotC since seventh grade, it felt hard to let it go :( but to be fair vex V5 was such a better system.
